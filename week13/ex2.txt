Recovery

Recovery is suitable for a small amount of running programs, so we do not spend
much time to detect deadlocks. In this way we get rid of deadlocks 
only when they appear. Also, recovery throught killing processes 
is the simplest way to break a deadlock.

Prevention

Prevention is suitable for the programs for which we have no information about
future requests. Also we should be able to set some limitations for the system
to break one of the conditions for deadlocks stated by Coffman. 


Avoidance

Avoidance is suitable for the programs for which we know information about 
future requests. If we know the resources that the process will request, we can say
if it leads to an unsafe state.
