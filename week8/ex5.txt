A physical memory is a memory provided by the hardware.
A virtual memory is a memory provided by the OS to the processes.
The virtual memory might be more that the physical memory (if OS supports swapping).
The virtual memory is also a good way to isolate processes: they works with the
virtual addresses, not real. Everytime a process accesses a memory with the virtual address,
the address is mapped into the address of physical memory.
